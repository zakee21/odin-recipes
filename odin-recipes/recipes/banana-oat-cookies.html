    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This breakfast or snack can be made with minimal ingredients and customized with any add-ins you desire.
            <br>These can go great with a side of fresh fruit.
        </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup of rolled oats</li>
            <li>2 medium-large ripe bananas</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 F.</li>
            <li>Mash bananas in medium sized bowl until you achieve puree like consistency.</li>
            <li>In a food processor or blender, pulse the oats for 10 seconds to break into smaller fragments or blend into oat flour. <br> This helps the cookies hold together. In a pinch, this recipe will also work with whole rolled oats. All options work, but will give the cookies a different texture.</li>
            <li>Stir the oats, mashed bananas, and any add-ins to form a batter.</li>
            <li>Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper or a silicone mat, scoop out desired amount of cookie dough and press down <br> gently to flatten into cookies.</li>
            <li>Bake for 15 minutes or until golden brown.</li>
        </ol>
